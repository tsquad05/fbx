Levels, panning, and effects such as EQ (Equalizer) and compression are put on the tracks to make them sound cohesive."},{question:"What is mastering?",answer:"Mastering is the post-production stage of your audio, which involves preparing and processing your audio mix into its final form to make it ready for distribution. This may include transitioning and sequencing the songs in your mix."},{question:"How to pick  the right mastering engineer for my music?",answer:"Some of the top qualities and skills of great mastering engineers are as follows: they've had extensive education in the art, they are passionate about music, they have great hearing, they're able to adapt to new technology, they have the ability to bring out the emotions in music, and they understand audio balance."},{question:"What can I expect from mixing & mastering professionals?",answer:"If you want your music to sound professional and competitive, the services of a mixing & mastering professional are essential. \nMusic mixing and mastering are separate activities but are both crucial to the production process. In the past you might’ve needed to have your songs professionally mixed and mastered by an engineer in a recording studio, technology is now becoming so widely available and affordable that it can all be done with much less equipment and almost everyone can afford freelance services."},{question:"Why should I invest in an audio engineer for mixing and mastering my tracks?",answer:"You’ve worked hard to record and arrange your tracks, paid a composer and a session musician, so it’s definitely worth it to get a professional to mix and master them. It might be too challenging and timely to go DIY so if you’re planning to release a professional album, you need professional help. Even if you are recording just for fun, you can still find some great value freelance services to mix & master it."},{question:"How to work remotely with a mixing engineer?",answer:"It’s possible to conduct the mix sessions virtually via Zoom, so make sure you provide your files in the right format (e.g. WAV or AIFF) prior to it. Once you agree with the sound engineer how you’ll attend, then during the mix session the output of the system will be mirrored and streamed to you which means you can work with a professional anywhere in the world without physically being in the same recording studio at the same time."}]},11:{metadata:{meta_title:"Jingles & Intros Production Services by Freelance Experts - Fiverr",meta_description:"Looking for Jingles & Intros Production Services? Browse Fiverr freelancers by skills, reviews, and price. Select the right Freelancer to meet your needs and budget."},faqs:[{question:"What is the difference between a Jingle and an Intro?",answer:"Even though the two terms are used interchangeably, there is a difference. Intros generally mark the start of a song (while outros are the finish). They aim to spark the listener’s curiosity and introduce the song’s melody. A jingle is frequently used in branding or advertising, and it can be associated with the audio logo of a company i.e. its acoustical voice. It connects the listener to a product or service even if it’s just a short two-tone sequence."},{question:"How can I hire the best freelancer for my project?",answer:"Research is key when it comes to choosing the right seller. Experience and skills at the right price are very important for shortlisting the top contenders. Once you’ve done that, get in touch and find out who can do the work on time and, most importantly, will have the right work ethic and personality to match yours. Don’t forget to ask what software and tools the freelancer is using to ensure they know their stuff to deliver quality output."},{question:"What will the freelancer expect from me when I order jingle or intro?",answer:"Every freelancer will have a set of requirements/questions that you’ll need to provide information on before they start working for you. It’s always best to contact them first and once you’ve committed to ordering, provide all required information promptly so you don’t slow down the delivery. Clearly state the purpose/target publishing platform for the project, e.g.podcast, commercial, YouTube etc, your preferred style such as instrumental and any other preferences you might have."},{question:"How frequently will the freelancer be in touch with me while working on my Jingle or Intro?",answer:"This really depends on the type of project and on your preferred style of work as well as that of the freelancer. If you want to keep a close tab on every step of the process, share this, in the beginning, to ensure the seller agrees. Most gigs come with a predefined number of revisions and if you’re not sure what’s included (and what’s not) in a revision, ask your seller before committing."},{question:"What are the advantages of hiring a Fiverr freelancer to create my Jingle?",answer:"Experience and skill are top of mind when it comes to reasons for hiring a freelancer as opposed to doing it yourself (might seem cheap but will the final result be a good one) or hiring an expensive production company or advertising agency. Fiverr is the home of hundreds and thousands of freelancers from across the globe who can offer great value for money services and an almost unlimited choice of people to work with."},{question:"Can I request a superfast Jingle or Intro delivery within 24 hours?",answer:"If you have a real creative emergency and need a new or replacement jingle or intro, then Fiverr is the right place for you. With freelancers available 24/7 we’re never short on talent and we literally never sleep. There’s always someone available to respond to your Buyer Request or to chat if you connect directly.

Hire a freelance voice actor expert services today and get your voice over project done remotely online within 24hr"},faqs:[{question:"What is voice over and what will I get?",answer:"Voice over is a production technique where a voice that is not part of the narrative is heard over the action. It’s often used in movies, TV shows, plays, or other presentations. Voice over is an effective way to convey information that doesn’t naturally fit into the plot or the other visual elements that are occurring. Voice over work is read by a voice actor who reads from a script, and it is added to the other elements during production."},{question:"What makes a good voice over?",answer:"The quality of your voice over depends almost entirely o the skill of the voice actor you use. A good voice actor will have perfect enunciation (ie, be very easy to understand), speak at an ideal pace (not too fast and not too slow), and have a pleasing voice. They should also be good at acting, and able to convey the feeling or emotions required by the script, using vocal variance and tone to keep the words interesting while also embodying the desired mood."},{question:"Do I need to prepare something for my voice over actor?",answer:"A professional voice actor will be able to give you guidance on how best to proceed with your voice over. However, you will need to prepare the script you want them to read, and explain the desired tone of the piece. You will need to have a good understanding of how you want it to sound, and be able to explain that clearly."},{question:"How do I choose the right voice over professional?",answer:"Once you’ve identified a pool of candidates based on skills and availability, look at their experience and browse their gig gallery. Listen to samples of previous voice-over work to get a sense of their style, and choose the candidate whose style you like best. You can contact them before ordering, explain your project requirements, expectations, and budget, and provide examples of work you like by the seller or someone else as an audio reference."},{question:"What should I ask a voice-over actor I want to hire?",answer:"Asking the right questions will help you assess how good a fit the voice actor is for your project. To assess if they have the vocal range needed for your purposes, ask for demos and listen. Ask what recording equipment they use. You really get what you pay for in this case.\nAlways ask what experience they have and read the reviews of other customers. If not sufficient or not relevant to your requirements, ask for more references."},{question:"Which other factors are important when hiring a voice actor?",answer:"Nowadays, voice acting is a far cry from what radio and tv commercials sounded like in the past. The proliferation of video and lowering of barriers for publishing on numerous channels increases the demand for a variety of voice acting skills and also the supply. Previous VO experience is key so always ask for published work and research the actor's media reputation. Ask them for ‘in character’ examples and also about availability especially if considering a long-term project."}]},17:{metadata:{meta_title:"Sound Effects Services from Freelance Audio Experts | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Sound Effects Services.

Freelancers also use stock sounds from libraries instead of custom-made, which is reflected in the price and delivery time."},{question:"Will the freelancer also edit my video, write music and do voiceover?",answer:"Some freelancers have cross-functional experience in many areas, however, a typical sound designer will not include video editing, original music writing or voiceover as default in their gigs for sound effects and foley. Always read carefully the description and services included in the gig and DM the seller to check if they are able to offer the additional services as extras and so they can also make adjustments to the delivery time and price."},{question:"What will I need to provide before the sound designer can start work?",answer:"Most freelancers on Fiverr publish a set of requirements for their gigs that are mandatory for starting the order. Normally, you’ll be asked to provide the original files for your film, explainer video, a link to your app or game or any other source files to which the sound will be added. Depending on what’s included in the gig, the freelancer will also ask you to specify the type of foley, sound effects or other sound editing/design that you require."},{question:"What will a foley artist do for my film or video?",answer:"Foley artists (named after Jack Foley) specialize in reproducing every day sounds like wind, blowing, footsteps, doors, glass breaking and other ambient noise. Those sounds enhance the auditory experience of a film, a show or any other audiovisual project. The three main types of foley used in production sounds are footsteps (different shoes, floor surfaces); movement (clothes rustling, people brushing past each other or bumping into something) and specific non-movement sound effects (phone ringing, traffic noise, nature sounds, etc.)."}]},18:{metadata:{meta_title:"Custom Ringtones, Custom Ring, Get Ringtones | Fiverr.com",meta_description:"Custom ringtones on Fiverr.

Other parties you might need to share your business plan with are bankers, potential partners, board members, and lawyers."},{question:"What are some key elements needed in a business plan?",answer:"Whether a business plan is to be shared with investors or partners, the key elements every business plan should have are an executive summary, a business overview, market analysis, competitive analysis, a section on organization and management, a description of your product or service, a sales and marketing strategy, and a financial plan."},{question:"Why is there a need for a business plan",answer:"People often believe that a business plan is for startups that need investments or for businesses that need a loan. However, while a business plan is especially useful for new companies, every company benefits from having them. Business plans hold you accountable and in line with your vision and mission. It also helps prioritise your goals and develop a strategic course of action.

Both are extremely important for a successful book."},{question:"What makes a good book cover design?",answer:"Book cover design is a visualization of your book's content.

Hire a freelance Photoshop Designer expert services & get your Photoshop project within 24hr"},faqs:[{question:"Why and when might you want to outsource photo editing/retouching?",answer:"You might want to consider outsourcing photo editing and retouching tasks in two basic scenarios: (1) When you have a lot of images needing a little bit of touching up, resizing, reformatting, or editing work; and (2) when you’ve got an image file or files in need of a lot of work -- for example, you need to combine several shots of the same basic composition into a single, perfected image. And you could also benefit from outsourcing to an experienced photo editor when you’re just pressed for time and your attention would be better spent on tasks you can’t outsource."},{question:"Why is Photoshop necessary for web design?",answer:"Photoshop is a popular tool of choice for web designers and developers, because it helps create web-friendly files that can be used in a number of ways. Photoshop files can be “translated” into HTML and CSS; used as background images for websites; and created to provide clear, crisp logo files for website headers. In many cases for website work, you’ll need image files in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format instead of pixel-based formats, such as JPEG and PNG. That’s because vector-based graphics can be cleanly resized, whereas pixel-based graphics are more limited; you can’t increase a PNG file’s size dramatically without losing the image’s clarity."},{question:"What if I have multiple photographs that need to be edited?",answer:"Most sellers offer batch pricing if you have multiple images that need editing, especially if similar processes will be applied to each image. Carefully check a Gig’s structure to note how many images are included in the price of a single Gig. If the description doesn’t specify a total number of images, message the seller and ask. Most sellers are happy to create a custom offer for your specific volume needs. Additionally, many sellers who offer Triple Packages include multiple images in their higher-priced package tiers."},{question:"What’s a source file and do I need one?",answer:"A source file is an editable, layered file that allows you or anyone else to make additional changes to the work more easily. In this subcategory, Source Files are almost always in the .PSD format native to Photoshop. If you do not purchase the Source File, you will just receive the static image file (usually .JPEG, .PNG, .GIF, or .TIFF). If you are not planning on making additional edits to the file beyond simple cropping or resizing, you probably do not need the Source File."},{question:"How can product photo editing & retouching boost my online e-commerce business?",answer:"In e-Commerce, it’s essential to build trust with your prospective customers. You can do this in a number of ways -- customer ratings, reviews, social proof, etc. -- but one thing you should pay special attention to is the quality of your product images. Customers who can clearly see what they’re contemplating buying have a lot more faith in the seller and are more willing to trust you with their purchase! But unless you’re a highly skilled photographer, chances are your product images will need to be resized, touched up, and “finished” to display your products to their best advantage and achieve a consistent branding image across your entire site."},{question:"How does photo editing/retouching help with magazine and brochure advertisements?",answer:"Image quality is a crucial factor in the success or failure of any print advertising campaign. While the right image can effectively sell a product even without a written copy, a low-quality, out of focus, or oddly composed image can send a prospective customer running to the competition. Photo editing and retouching can easily fine-tune and perfect your images, transforming a so-so photo into a dynamic, eye-catching one that helps you sell your products and services."}]},54:{metadata:{meta_title:"Powerpoint Design - Presentation Designer Services | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Presentation Design Services.

Another is if you suspect that your analytics setup is faulty. Since analytics can be very technical, hiring a web analyst will help you identify issues much quicker. Web analysts can also help you setup tagging via Google Tag Manager, and use other analytical tools like Google Data Studio. And they can generate reports to help you understand your data."},{question:"What is an analytics expert?",answer:"An analytics expert is someone who understands how to setup, run, and report on analytics installations, using a variety of analytics software. An expert also knows where there are potential data issues, and can help you to troubleshoot and avoid those.

It’s also useful to be able to get a related social media handle for a cohesive brand identity. Domain name research can be time-consuming, so consider hiring a domain search expert to help you"},{question:"Is a long domain name good or bad for SEO?",answer:"Many experts recommend that you go for short domain names. While long domain names aren’t necessarily bad for SEO, they can sometimes hurt your SEO by being hard to remember. If people mistype your domain name and end up somewhere else, then you lose that traffic. Long domain names, especially if they’re stuffed with keywords, can look like spam, and that’s another negative SEO signal. That’s why it makes sense to pick a short, memorable domain name whenever possible."},{question:"Can you just buy a domain name without hosting?",answer:"Yes, you can buy a domain name without hosting. That’s useful when you want a particular domain name, but you’re not ready to create a website. Once you’re ready to use the domain name, you’ll need to buy hosting, otherwise it’s like having a house with no land. Note that you don’t always have to buy your domain and your hosting from the same provider. You can shop around for the best hosting deal before making a final decision."},{question:"How do I transfer a domain name to a new host?",answer:"When your domain name is hosted in one place, it’s often locked to that host. Don’t worry, you will be able to move it, though you may have to pay a fee for the transfer. Usually, you have to ask your existing host to unlock the domain. Your old host will provide a code. Give this code to your new host to start the transfer. Pay any fees due, then the transfer will complete. This is a relatively quick process."},{question:"What is domain name registration?",answer:"Domain name registration is buying a domain name for a period. Use a registrar’s domain tools to check domain name availability. A domain name search will allow you to find domains related your brand with different top level domain extensions like .COM and .ORG. Once you find the domain name you want, complete the purchase, and the domain name is yours as long as you keep paying your fees. To have a working website, you also have to purchase hosting."},{question:"Expired vs. new domains - which one should I choose?",answer:"There are pros and cons to buying expired vs new domains. Domains expire when people no longer pay to reserve them. Sometimes expired domains benefit from existing inbound links and better SEO. However, some expired domains can also have a bad reputation, which won’t help your business. Consider hiring professional services to research expired domains, find out who’s selling, and make sure they haven’t been banned. If the domain isn’t on the level, you’re better off with a new domain."}]},63:{metadata:{meta_title:"Custom Fan Pages, Professional Fan Page Services | Fiverr ",meta_description:"Hire an expert to create a custom fan page on Facebook or any other social channel on Fiverr.com.

If search engines ignore your business, that results in less traffic and fewer leads."},{question:"How exactly does SEO work?",answer:"To understand how SEO works, you need to understand how Google works; Google finds and catalogs online content in a huge database. It analyzes the content quality, using a number of signals, to work out which web pages are relevant to which searches. Then, when people type in a phrase, Google shows them the most relevant results. Using SEO helps you improve how Google sees your content so it shows up for the right searches."},{question:"Why are keywords important?",answer:"Keywords and search phrases are an essential part of your Search Engine Optimization. That’s because keywords in content tell Google and other search engines that your content is relevant to a particular search intent. That relevance helps search engines show your content to the right people at the right time. This is why it’s so important to perform keyword research for both SEO and content marketing. If you’re not sure where to start, hire a professional SEO expert to find the keywords you need."},{question:"Why is technical SEO important?",answer:"While it’s important to write quality content for human readers, you also need to give search engines the possibility to properly crawl and index it. That’s where technical SEO comes in - as every page indexed enables your website to rank for the researched keywords contained on those pages, which means an additional point of entry and therefore, more traffic. Technical SEO includes a broad range of subjects, this is why it's better to perform periodical website SEO audits to make sure it is fully optimized for search engines as well."},{question:"What’s the difference between on-page and off-page SEO?",answer:"On-page SEO and off-page SEO are also known as on-site SEO and off-site SEO. On-page SEO is about making improvements on your site, for example by optimizing your pages content quality and meta tags around particular researched keywords. It also includes technical fixes to your site. Off-page SEO is about improving the perception of your website and business by building links, enhancing online authority and gathering social media signals via shared content. Any successful SEO strategy needs both on-page and off-page SEO."}]},66:{metadata:{meta_title:"Social Bookmarking Submission, Bookmarks and Link Building | Fiverr",meta_description:"Hire experts in social bookmarking submissions and site links to increase your website traffic.

Hashtag use varies according to the social media site. For Facebook, use no more than one hashtag. On Twitter, two hashtags are best for engagement. On Instagram, use a minimum of 9 and up to 30. Not sure which hashtags to use? Hire a social media expert to find the most effective hashtags for your social media platform so your content can get found."},{question:"What type of content works best on each social media platform?",answer:"The best types of content for each social media channel depends on the platform. Most social media sites allow you to share multiple types of social media content, including blog posts, images, animated GIFs, videos, and more. The research shows that images do well on Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Pinterest. Video content is also very popular. The best is to align your social media strategy with your content marketing to make sure you share the type of content your audience really likes."},{question:"What are the best practices for setting up a social media profile?",answer:"Consistency is one of the keys to social media marketing strategy success, so use the same profile picture and cover image across all social networks, resizing according to the site’s requirements. This helps boost your online marketing efforts by building a strong social media presence as well as to place you as a thought leader within your niche.

You can also include a link to your website or a resource you’re promoting as a call to action."},{question:"Why social media influencers matter?",answer:"The research shows that most people trust recommendations from social influencers, friends, and family much more than a company’s advertising and promotion. That’s why influencer marketing is such a powerful way to raise awareness of your products and services, and it should be integrated within your social media marketing plan. Of course, it’s important to find the right influencers to help promote your business. To do this, hire an influencer marketing expert to match you with influencers who are respected by the target audience you want to reach."},{question:"How can small business owners grow a social media following?",answer:"To successfully grow a social media following, you must make sure to have your social media profile set up right. This means getting a professional photo and cover image that relates to your business. Share content regularly but don’t be too promotional: around 80% of what you share on a social media channel should come from other people. Most importantly, be social, and don't rely too much on automation. A good idea is to have in place a social customer service providing fast and efficient costumer support to your followers."},{question:"How many social media platforms should I utilize?",answer:"Social networking isn’t a numbers game, so it's not about being active on a \"magic number\" of social media sites. It's more important to be active on the right social channels. Those are the ones where your target audience is most active. With 2 billion users across a wide age range, Facebook is a must for most people.

If you want to attract display traffic, consider hiring a graphic design expert to create attractive, click-worthy banners."},{question:"Why do backlinks affect web traffic?",answer:"The web is built on links, and web users routinely use links to find the information they need. When a site links to your site, web users follow those links, resulting in web traffic, or referral traffic. When these backlinks, also called inbound links, come from high quality sites, they also tell Google your content is authoritative and trustworthy. This is important because inbound links from respected sites are an SEO ranking factor, so they can boost organic traffic, too."},{question:"Why does influencer marketing drive traffic?",answer:"Influencer marketing drives traffic because most people trust recommendations from friends and influencers more than they trust companies’ ads and marketing. When an influencer recommends your product or services, the people who follow that influencer are sure to check it out. Because of this, influencer marketing is an effective way to attract visitors to your site, to get leads and make sales. To use this effectively, it’s important to identify and work with trusted influencers in your niche."},{question:"How do you track website traffic?",answer:"To track website traffic you need analytics software. That anonymously logs every visitor to your site and keeps track of their actions. One of the most popular analytics apps is Google Analytics. It’s free, but there can be a learning curve in getting it set up correctly. If you don’t add your tracking code the right way, then you won’t be able to track your traffic. Consider getting an analytics expert to help you create the right setup for your website."},{question:"How many web traffic sources are there?",answer:"There are several web traffic referral sources. Organic traffic comes from search engines. Referral traffic comes from other websites. Display traffic comes from ads for your business on other sites.

What's best?",answer:"While machine translation can help with translating basic, common words and phrases, human certified translation is much better. That’s because machines aren’t as good as humans at working out the writer’s intention. That means they won’t always select the appropriate translation for a particular word, phrase, or sentence. If you use machine translation alone, the overall translation won’t be of a good quality. A good middle ground can be to have a machine translation reviewed by a human certified translator."},{question:"Can I do anything to help the translation process?",answer:"You can help the translation process by providing clear, easy to understand source material for translation. It’s also a good idea to inform your translator about the audience for the document being translated so the translator can be sure to use the appropriate style and tone. That aside, most translators will let you know if there are any special requirements. It’s wise to check that your translator specialises in the area you need before making the final decision."},{question:"Do I need a separate proofreading service?",answer:"When you hire a translator, you don’t always need a separate proofreading service. Many translators include proofreading as part of the translation service.They’ll check to make sure that the final translation reads well, makes sense, and is faithful to the original document. However, you can’t always guarantee that your translator is an expert proofreader. If you want to make sure, consider hiring a professional proofreader to make a final check of your document before you use or publish it."},{question:"How can I trust that translations are accurate and culturally relevant?",answer:"The best way to get accurate, culturally relevant translations is to hire a professional translator who is a native speaker of the language you are translating into. That expertise will help the translator accurately convey any nuances or special meanings from your original text by using the appropriate words and phrases in the final document. If you’re unsure, consider getting another native speaker to proofread the translation so you can be sure it meets your needs."}]},109:{metadata:{meta_title:"Professional Transcription Services by Expert Transcribers | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Transcribing Services. Find a freelance transcriber for hire, outsource your audio or video transcription project and get it transcribed and delivered remotely online"},faqs:[{question:"What are the benefits of using transcription services?",answer:"Accurate transcription services offer several benefits. One of the main ones is extending the reach of your content by targeting people who prefer to consume content in different formats. Transcribing audio and video content makes it easy to repurpose it in blog posts, ebooks, and articles. And having transcribed content in podcast and video show notes is good for SEO. That means people will be able to find your content in search results more easily."},{question:"What is a standard transcription process?",answer:"Both audio transcription and video transcription start by supplying the source file or URL to the transcriber. Then the transcriber listens to the file and types out what they hear. After that, the transcript is double-checked to make sure nothing is missed. If there is content that’s hard to hear or understand, this is marked as inaudible in the transcript. Transcripts can include recording timings, which is useful for show notes. Some transcription services also include proofreading and editing."},{question:"What type of audio data can be transcribed?",answer:"Any kind of audio data can be transcribed, whether it’s from a digital audio file (MP3, WAV, AAC and so on) or from a video. The most important thing for transcription is to have a good quality recording. If the sound is muffled or inaudible, it is impossible for the transcriber to provide a complete transcript. When hiring a transcriber, check that they are happy to work with regional or international accents.This can also affect the quality of the transcript."},{question:"How can I save time when hiring a transcriber?",answer:"To save time when hiring a transcriber, follow the steps you would take to hire any professional. For example, within Fiverr, use the search functions to find transcribers who offer the specific service you want. Check their gigs to make sure they are skilled in dealing with the topic your recording covers. It’s also a good idea to ask for their price for audio minute in case it is not specified, as well as to look at reviews and star ratings so you immediately start with the top professionals. In case of doubts do not hesitate to contact Fiverr's customer service for advices or recommendations."},{question:"What is clean verbatim transcription?",answer:"Two of the types of transcription available are verbatim (or exact verbatim) transcription and clean verbatim transcription. As the name suggest, verbatim transcription includes everything that’s on the recording. So verbal tics such as “like”, “um”, “you know” and so on are included in the final transcript. Clean verbatim transcription removes the verbal tics so you get a clean transcript. Clean verbatim transcription is a good choice if you are planning to publish the transcript on a blog or website."},{question:"How long does it take to transcribe one hour of audio?",answer:"According to transcription professionals, the turnaround time to transcribe one hour of audio can be up to four hours. The transcriber has to pause the recording in order to write down what’s being said, and will listen to the recording more than once. The transcription process can take even longer if the transcriber receives a poor quality audio file, or if there are multiple speakers, or speakers who don’t speak clearly. Check that your chosen transcriber can work with international accents if this is an issue."}]},110:{metadata:{meta_title:"Article Writing & Web Content Writing Services | Fiverr",meta_description:"Find website content services on Fiverr.

Find a freelance resume writer for hire, outsource your resume writing or CV writing project remotely online"},faqs:[{question:"What should a resume include for a job search?",answer:"Generally a professional resume starts with your name and contact details, followed by a summary statement. After that make sure the resume writer also lists keywords that apply to your industry (these sometimes appear after the work experience section). Follow that with work experience (company name, job title, date of employment), making sure to list key accomplishments. Only list relevant jobs over the last 10 years. Then add your education, any relevant training or certifications and additional information (such as linkedin profile, career goals, volunteering, honors and awards)."},{question:"Why do you need a professional resume service?",answer:"A professionally written resume is your best chance to get the attention of a potential employer during a job interview. Most career experts who are hiring only spend a few seconds looking at a resume. Your resume must stand out and immediately grab the interest of the job search expert, otherwise it could end up in the discard pile if you don't get it right. This is where it's highly advisable to find and use professional resume writing services only."},{question:"Why do resumes get rejected?",answer:"Generally a career expert spends from 5 to 9 seconds reading your resume before making a decision. If your resume gets rejected it's because it doesn't showcase how you match the position you are applying for. Poor formatting, the inclusion of non-essential information or too much information, and grammatical and spelling errors are other typical reasons for rejection. This is where getting help from a professional resume writer makes sense."},{question:"What are the most popular resume formats?",answer:"There are three main resume formats: Reverse-chronological resumes list work experiences and skills in reverse-chronological order. This is the most common resume format. Functional resumes focus on skills as opposed to chronology and work experiences. Combination resumes are hybrids of the above resume formats. They highlight your work experience in reverse-chronological order, but also have sections on your skillset. The format you choose will depend on the nature of the position you’re applying for."},{question:"How long should a resume be?",answer:"Some job advertisements specify how long they’d like your resume to be. In this case, it’s important to stick to these guidelines. If no length is specified, one or two pages is ideal. However, it’s important to remember that being concise is key—short, to-the-point resumes are preferable to lengthy resumes. This is because some vacancies receive dozens, or even hundreds, of applications. Recruiters seldom want to read through dozens of long applications that waffle or include irrelevant information."},{question:"Do I need a different resume for every job I apply to?",answer:"Ideally, yes. Since each job requires different skills and capabilities, it’s a good idea to adapt your resume depending on the job you’re applying to. For example, if you’re applying for a job in marine biology, your experience in volunteering at the aquarium would be relevant, but if you’re applying for an administrative position, you should highlight your experience as a virtual assistant. However, the basic structure and information on your resume can stay the same."}]},113:{metadata:{meta_title:"Speech writing services, Speech writing tips, Speech writers | Fiverr",meta_description:"Speech writing services.

Proofreading is the very last step to identify potential run-on sentences as well as to find avoidable spelling errors or grammatical errors"},{question:"What should I look for in a proofreader or copy-editor?",answer:"Both copy-editors and professional proofreaders should have above-average competence in the languages they are correcting. For example, they may have a degree in their native language as well as editing and proofreading certifications. But that's not all, a good proofreader should also be familiar with the the most popular style guides versions such as AMA, AP, APA, MLS, CMS or Bluebook."},{question:"What does proofreading involve?",answer:"Proofreading involves checking an almost-final document or publication for typographical errors, spelling errors or grammatical errors. It does NOT involve checking the flow of the copy and effectiveness of the message."},{question:"Why do I need a proofreader or copy-editor?",answer:"When you write something yourself, it's easy to see what you expect to see, so you can miss errors when checking. Someone else such as a professional proofreader or copy-editor who is not as close to the document will often spot ways to improve it."},{question:"Why is proofreading important in translation?",answer:"Machine translation is widely used in translation, but machines can't always grasp the nuances of the language. A good proofreader with years of experience will help you eliminate grammar errors or typographical errors that could completely change the meaning of your writing."},{question:"Why is proofreading important in business?",answer:"Getting copy wrong can be a costly error in business.

After that, the first paragraph introduces people to your story. Most press releases state whether they are “for immediate release” which means the news can be published right away, or “embargoed”, which means it can’t be published before a particular deadline. All press releases include contact information like a phone number and email address."},{question:"What is the purpose of the press release?",answer:"The purpose of a press release, which is also called a news release or media release, is to make an announcement to the press and the public, such as for a new product or service. Before social media, this was how companies got their news to the attention of journalists. While some press releases are published on free press release sites, many are issued on companies’ own websites, and then shared with the public via social media and email marketing."},{question:"Why hire a professional press release writer?",answer:"If you want a great press release that’s guaranteed to get shared and published, then hire a professional press release writer. A professional press release writer understands that the press release is part of a public relations campaign, and knows how to write the headline and first paragraph to attract your audience.

The research shows that it’s most likely people will read your press release if you send it between 10am and 2pm. If your recipients are in different time zones, optimize your send times accordingly."}]},117:{metadata:{meta_title:"Small Business Creative Video Services Online | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Small Business Creative Video Services.

Otherwise, you risk wasting a lot of time, money and the opportunity to work with a talented composer for lack of proper communication. The process of composing and arranging music is quite complex and no two projects are the same. Make sure you iron out misunderstandings early, examine the work in progress by feeding back on the free demos to assess the sound quality and style in the context of your project."},{question:"Should I hire both a producer and a composer?",answer:"Start by understanding that a composer writes the music, whereas the producer takes charge of the final product. If you are working on a big-scale music production or an entire album the composer will work with the artists to create the song, whereas the producer is like a creative leader, supporting them in developing the overall vision for the song, the album, the project.

Give them a vocal demo of your final song, the lyrics and the instrumentals before you start the work."},{question:"What questions should I ask before hiring a singer or a vocalist?",answer:"Most experienced professionals already have answers to your most pressing questions in their profile and will give you more once you contact them.

Most sellers will not accept major modifications to the final product."},{question:"Can I ask for a revision once the order has been closed?",answer:"Once your order is closed, most sellers will not provide further work. Plan your time so you can review the delivery up to 3 days after receiving it. Many sellers will deliver earlier than the deadline, so keep an eye on your notifications and download the Fiverr app so you’re always able to stay in touch. You’ll have time for the agreed number of revisions with the seller and after each revision you’ll have 3 days for review."},{question:"Does the wrap have to be for the whole vehicle?",answer:"No, you don’t have to order a wrap for your entire car.  You can just change the colour or design on parts of it, such as the roof, the doors, etc. You can also use decals or stickers to change the design of the car, with the application method being the same. Ask the designer whether he/she can help you with that as the printing and application afterwards is very similar to wrapping."}]},346:{metadata:{meta_title:"Audio Editing by Freelance Audio Editors | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Audio Editing & Post Production Services for Videos, Video Games, Podcasts and more."},faqs:[{question:"What can I expect from a freelancer who provides dialogue sound editing?",answer:"Freelancers who specialize in dialogue editing for film & video, radio & audio ads, video games and phone systems/IVR will offer a great variety of services depending on your needs and their experience.

That’s why it’s always best to contact the seller and discuss your requirements before ordering it. He/she will then be able to provide you with a custom offer whether your audio is longer or you have specific challenges or need it done as an express order because you’re pressed for time."},{question:"How can I make sure that a freelancer will be suitable for my specific dialogue needs?",answer:"After you’ve done your research on available freelancers and their gigs, checked their portfolio and read the reviews, you can also contact them to request a free sample.

As audio files can be quite big, always ensure that you agree on what service (such as Google Drive, iCloud, WeTransfer or others) to use to send and receive them."}]},347:{metadata:{meta_title:"Beta Readers for Books, eBooks & Manuscripts | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable beta reading services. Find a beta reader for hire online to beta read your author's manuscript and provide you with valuable feedback"},faqs:[{question:"What is a Beta reader?",answer:"A beta reader is an early reader of your manuscript. The term grew out of the software industry, where beta testers took early versions of software for a trial run. It's similar with your book. Beta readers will read and give constructive feedback on your book so you can improve it before launching it publicly. This ensures you have the best possible book before launch. You can easily find people willing to read your book in Fiverr's beta reader category."},{question:"What are the main reasons you need a Beta reader?",answer:"One of the main reasons why you need a Beta reader is because you can get too involved in your book. When you do, you no longer see the flaws, only what you expect to see. Beta readers can help you identify what's working and what needs improvement in your book. In addition, Beta readers are more objective. As a writer, it can be hard for you to identify the fixes needed to make your book more readable and marketable."},{question:"What makes a good Beta reader?",answer:"Good Beta readers enjoy reading, and are interested in the genre you're writing in. They'll probably be part of your ideal target market. Ideally, they'll read the book and make detailed observations that truly help you to improve your manuscript. A good Beta reader knows how to give constructive criticism and helpful feedback. Ideally, Beta readers won't be family members, because they may be afraid of giving their honest opinion. You can find Beta readers for all genres on Fiverr."},{question:"What's the difference between a Beta reader and an editor?",answer:"An editor is a professional who understands story structure and writing techniques. Editors who read your book will work on your book to improve how the story flows, how characters develop and other technical aspects of writing. Beta readers look at some of the same issues from a reader's view point. While beta readers may know that characters don't feel right, editors know how to fix that, and will. Both beta readers and editors help you create a better book."},{question:"What's the difference between a Beta reader and an Alpha reader?",answer:"The big difference between a Beta reader and an Alpha reader is when they see your book. Alpha readers see early drafts which aren't totally polished yet. So, alpha readers may have more influence on the final book. Beta readers see an almost final version of a book, that's close to being ready for publication, so these readers can give constructive criticism. They have less influence on the final book because many of the major issues are already dealt with."},{question:"How can I choose the best Beta reader for my book?",answer:"To choose the best Beta reader for your book, select people who are interested in the genre you are writing in. There's no point in sending a romance book to someone who prefers to read science fiction. Ideally, your Beta reader will be fluent in the language you're writing in, and will give constructive feedback. Don't confuse Beta readers with proofreaders and editors. Beta readers assess your book from the reader's viewpoint, which is valuable for a writer."}]},349:{metadata:{meta_title:"Vocal Tuning by Freelance Audio Editors | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Vocal Tuning Services.

Once you’ve done that, get in touch with the top 3 to 5 contenders and ask for a free consultation about your project.

One of the greatest benefits of Fiverr is the fact that we have global coverage which means that there’s always a freelancer available to take your order and most importantly deliver it fast. Always contact the seller before placing an express order, to ensure that he/she is available and has spare capacity to take on your project. Remember that you also need to be available to answer questions while work is in progress."},{question:"How much can a freelancer do to improve my vocal recordings?",answer:"Freelancers on Fiverr come from different backgrounds and you can find top professionals with years of experience and great skills for pitch correcting, tuning, mixing and audio editing. However, be realistic in your expectations as there is a limit to how much a professional can do to enhance the quality of your vocal recordings. The final result, after all the processing, tuning, mixing, time-alignment and so on, will be much better than the original and the vocals more polished."},{question:"What can I expect from the vocal tuning process?",answer:"Once you’ve decided to order a gig to optimize the sound of your song, you’ll likely have an in-depth conversation with the freelancer or creative team that’ll do the work about the direction in which you’d like your vocals to go. You’ll be asked for references and any specific requirements. After that, the professionals will manipulate your vocals using various techniques, software and plugins and ask for your feedback in iterations until the work is done to your satisfaction."},{question:"What are the benefits of using a freelance professional to do vocal tuning for my song?",answer:"Like with many services on Fiverr, one of the greatest benefits is the huge choice of experienced and ready available professionals who can bring you their services at any time and for a fraction of what an agency will probably charge you.

Find a crowdfunding consultant for hire, outsource your crowdfunding campaign creation and marketing projects"},faqs:[{question:"What is crowdfunding and how does it work?",answer:'At its simplest, crowdfunding is using an online platform to raise funds. It usually works by allowing several people to contribute small amounts until the person running the crowdfunding campaign achieves their financial goal. Some crowdfunding platforms take an "all or nothing" approach, which means you only get the funds if you raise the total amount required. Others allow people running crowdfunding campaigns to keep all the funding raised, even if they don\'t reach the funding goal.'},{question:"What are the 5 best crowdfunding sites for startups?",answer:"Crowdfunding is a hugely popular way to finance a new business venture, so there are plenty of crowdfunding sites for startups. Kickstarter is one of the best-known crowdfunding sites. While Business.org suggests it is especially good for creative businesses, you'll find businesses offering all kinds of products and services on Kickstarter. Other popular crowdfunding sites include Indiegogo, which is great for tech projects, RocketHub, for social good projects, GoFundMe for charitable causes, and IFundWomen, for funding women-owned startups."},{question:"What are the four main types of crowdfunding?",answer:"The four main types of crowdfunding are donation-based crowdfunding, reward-based crowdfunding, equity-based crowdfunding, and debt-based crowdfunding. In donation-based crowdfunding, all funds are donations, with nothing but goodwill and gratitude in exchange. Reward-based crowdfunding offers different rewards for different contributions.

This will identify the problem, say how your business idea will solve it, and let people know why yours is a good business to contribute to.

When you use a crowdfunding service provider, you'll get professional advice on the best way to present your pitch to achieve success.

Whichever platform you're on, make sure your pitch, video and rewards are all ready before you launch to give you the best chance of a successful campaign"}]},353:{metadata:{meta_title:"Professional Scriptwriting by Freelance Script Writers | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Online Script Writing Services. Find a freelance script writer for hire, outsource your scriptwriting project and get it delivered remotely online"},faqs:[{question:"How long should a screenplay be?",answer:"When scriptwriting, there's no specific length for the perfect screenplay. For most scripts, a single page is equal to a minute of time on screen. So, if you need to hire scriptwriting services, expect that you'll get at least a 90-page script for a movie that lasts an hour and a half. Many scripts for feature films end up at between 110 and 120 pages. Make sure your screenplay is correctly formatted to include scenes and stage directions."},{question:"Who gets credit for a screenplay?",answer:"Screenplay writing credit can be a complex issue. According to the Writer's Guild of America (WGA), screenplay writing credits are usually shared by no more than two writers or two teams of writers. In order to get credit, writers must make a significant contribution to the finished screenplay. If you are hiring a scriptwriter on Fiverr to ghostwrite a screenplay for you, then that is work for hire, and you will be credited as the author of the screenplay."},{question:"What are the differences between screenwriting and script writing?",answer:'There are differences between screenwriting and scriptwriting, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. Scriptwriting generally covers what people say, such as actors in a TV show or movie, or people voicing a video. Screenwriting includes settings, camera angles, and directions, as well as the dialog. TV and movie directors use screenplays to create the right mood when directing a film. Screenplays are sometimes called "shooting scripts". There are also theatre scripts, which include stage directions and dialog.'},{question:"How do I copyright a script online?",answer:"The moment you write it, your script is protected by copyright. However, if you ever need to prove ownership, it's useful to copyright your script online. In the US, you can do this via the US Copyright Office. Login, complete the application, and pay the registration fee, which ranges between $35 and $55. Once that's done, upload a copy of your work, and you'll get an email acknowledging your application. A few months later, you'll get confirmation of your copyright."},{question:"What are the qualities of a good script writer?",answer:"Some of the key qualities of a good script writer are proven writing skills, excellent spelling, and impeccable grammar. Good script writers are extremely creative, and can easily bring ideas to life. They know how to create scripts for different occasions in various tones of voice. Ideally, the scriptwriter will understand industry requirements for TV, films, theater, and business videos, and will be able to handle screenplay writing, if required. Script writers must also cope well with the revision process."},{question:"What makes a good script?",answer:"Many of the elements of a good script relate to storytelling. A good script starts with an interesting plot that hooks viewers from the start. Another quality of a great script is developing the plot via a well-paced storyline. Great scripts get viewers invested in the characters. Like all good stories, great scripts include a conflict that's resolved, and character development. If your script is for a TV show, video, or movie, then scriptwriters must think about eye-catching visuals."}]},354:{metadata:{meta_title:"Book Editing Services by Freelance Book Editors | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Book Writing Services.

Ghostwriters usually write on a "work for hire" basis, which means they have no rights to the finished work. Instead, the credited author owns the copyright. Many people hire ghostwriters when they don\'t have the time or writing skills to write content themselves. Ghostwriters write a range of content, including books and ebooks; business white papers, case studies and research reports; song lyrics; and ebooks.'},{question:"What is the difference between a ghost writer and an author?",answer:"The difference between a ghostwriter and an author or co-author mostly comes down to credit. Ghostwriters don't usually receive credit for their work. They generally deliver the writing that supports the author's vision for the book. However, on some ghostwritten material, like biographies, ghostwriters are credited as having created the book \"with\" the author. Co-authors are considered jointly responsible for the content of a book, and share the copyright. Meanwhile authors own the complete copyright to a published work."},{question:"What makes a good ghostwriter?",answer:"As you'd expect, one of the main qualities of a good ghostwriter is excellent writing skills. Like other writers, ghostwriters must be able to understand how to structure books, articles, reports, or any other ghostwritten material. Industry knowledge and excellent spelling and grammar are assets. Often, ghostwriters need excellent research skills, and must be well-organised to keep track of all the information they gather. It's useful for ghostwriters to understand publishing and self-publishing so they can assist clients with publication."},{question:"How can I hire a good ghostwriter?",answer:"Before you think about hiring a ghostwriter, it's essential to have a plan for what you want the ghostwriter to write. This will help when you're deciding which ghostwriter is right for you. You can find good ghostwriters by searching the web, or by looking for them on freelance marketplaces like Fiverr. If you're using a marketplace, check ghostwriters' profiles for ratings, reviews, and work samples. Then have a conversation to see if that ghostwriter is right for your project."},{question:"Is ghostwriting legal?",answer:"Many people wonder if ghostwriting is legal. The answer is: yes, it is. Typically, ghostwriting is work for hire, where a client agrees to buy writing services from a ghostwriter, and the ghostwriter agrees to work for a set fee. In this transaction, ghostwriters know they won't be credited for the work. Publishing houses have used ghostwriters for years. In some cases, ghostwriters help with biographies. In others, they help write book series, like the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books."},{question:"Do ghostwriters get royalties?",answer:"Most ghostwriters don't get royalties for their writing. With ghostwriting, the person doing the writing is not the credited author, and writes on a \"work for hire\" basis. This means the ghostwriter is paid upfront for doing the writing. Meanwhile, the credited author is the one who gets the royalties. Some people ask ghostwriters to lower their fees in exchange for a share of royalties. Unless your book is likely to be a bestseller, most ghostwriters won't do this."}]},355:{metadata:{meta_title:"Speechwriting Services: Find Speech Writers for Hire Online | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Speechwriting Services.

Find a freelance affiliate marketer for hire, outsource your affiliate marketing projects remotely"},faqs:[{question:"What is affiliate marketing?",answer:"Affiliate marketing is based on the concept that the affiliate promotes another person’s or company’s products or services and earns a commission for it. All sales are tracked via affiliate links and the affiliate takes a percentage of the profit from each sale from their website, blog, social media, app, etc. It is a very popular tactic to drive sales, generate online revenue and profits by benefiting the brands and the affiliate marketers and spreading the risk between them."},{question:"How does affiliate marketing work?",answer:"There are three main elements to affiliate marketing. First, the seller (‘the brand’ or ‘merchant’), an individual or a company who creates the product or service and might be involved or not in marketing it. Second, the affiliate (or publisher), a person or an enterprise who promotes the product to their audience and gets a share of the retail price. The third key participant in the process is the consumer who purchases the products/services via the affiliate site."},{question:"How do affiliates get paid?",answer:"There are different ways in which affiliate companies reward their affiliates depending on their objectives. The three main performance-based payment models are pay-per-click, pay-per-lead, or pay-per-sale, where the latter two are preferred for being more advantageous to the merchant. Because all three types are based on how well the affiliate is performing in contributing towards the company’s goal, they are also known as performance marketing. The commissions earned by affiliates are paid at regular intervals, usually on a monthly basis."},{question:"What is an affiliate?",answer:"The term affiliate defines two very distinct business concepts. In Corporate and Tax Law, an ‘affiliate’ is a company connected to another company as a subsidiary or a member. In the context of online commerce and marketing, an affiliate is a company, or an individual, who sells or markets the products or services of another company. The seller (or merchant) offers affiliate links containing tracking codes so every sale or referral can be tracked and commission paid to the affiliate."},{question:"Is affiliate marketing worth the effort?",answer:"The short answer is ‘Yes, absolutely!’. It can bring big rewards but it certainly needs an investment of time and effort. As an affiliate, it is important to focus on a category you understand and can focus on. Then, define a highly targeted and ready-to-buy audience and attract them with the right keywords and by promoting your site, blog, or social media profile to them. Finally, stay abreast of digital marketing developments and don’t be afraid to learn via trial and error."},{question:"Is affiliate marketing legit?",answer:"It’s natural to be wary of illegal schemes where affiliate marketing is concerned. Think of it as any other type of digital advertising i.e. you, the affiliate, get paid to promote someone else’s products. Like all advertising, you get ‘white hat affiliates’ who stick to the rules and work for the mutual benefit of both the merchant and themselves. Whereas, ‘black hat affiliates’ might use not-so-legit means such as pop-ups, flashy banners, and link cloaking to promote the products they sell."}]},441:{metadata:{meta_title:"Fashion design services by fashion designers | Fiverr",meta_description:"Best fashion freelance services online.

It still delivers a great return on investment (ROI) for most businesses even though a very small percentage of people click on display ads.

Responsive display ads get their name from the fact that the platform decides how to place the best-performing combination of text headlines and descriptions and formats for the target audience. Other main types are native ads (displayed in the same style as the host site), social ads (in social media), retargeting (aka remarketing) and discovery ads."},{question:"What is native advertising?",answer:"Native ads are a type of display ads that complement the look and feel and also the functionality of the online media format in which they are shown. You can see them on web pages as recommended content, on social media feeds on networks such as YouTube and in email newsletters etc. They blend in with the rest of the content, similar to the editorial in printed media, and don’t look like ads which is the main objective of using this display ad format."}]},445:{metadata:{meta_title:"Lottie & Website Animation Services | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Lottie & Website Animation Services from Freelance Lottie Animators and Motion Designers.

This makes an SMS one of the most direct, cheapest, and attention-grabbing ways to deliver your marketing message."},{question:"How does text messaging work for businesses?",answer:"Marketing via SMS is a simple two-step process. Before you start texting, you need to give your potential customers a way to opt-in to receiving communication from you via SMS or MMS. This can be done via keywords, web, or paper forms.

It consistently performs better than other channels as customers seem to be highly receptive to engaging with text messages."},{question:"Why is text message marketing so effective?",answer:"SMS marketing is effective due to a few key facts. Firstly, almost all of your potential audience owns a telephone and will receive a text which they’re not likely to ignore.

Finally, people read their texts almost immediately so you can have a high response rate to the right message."},{question:"Is SMS text marketing legal?",answer:"The law allows businesses to use text message marketing however it regulates it heavily in different countries so consumers who do not wish to receive any text messages are protected.

In addition to the governing bodies (e.g. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US), there are mobile carrier conglomerates that have their own codes of conduct to monitor business behavior and impose restrictions if needed."},{question:"When should businesses use text message marketing?",answer:"In order to abide by industry etiquette and follow a code of conduct, businesses should adhere to some rules when sending text messages. It’s recommended that marketers only send SMS during business hours (Monday-Friday from 8 am to 6 pm) according to the different time zones of the customers unless the message is for a time-sensitive offer or in response to an order/customer service inquiry.

Hire a freelance Databases expert services today and get your Databases project done remotely online within 24hr"},faqs:[{question:"What is a Database?",answer:"First of all, the term “database” should not be confused with “data storage.” A database is not a physical or virtual warehouse. It is data itself, but in an organized form. \nAlthough some deviations from the following definition are possible, you can imagine a database as a collection of two-dimensional tables. Each table consists of rows that contain records or observations and columns that contain their attributes. Columns in different tables may be related to each other; this is what is known as a classical relational database."},{question:"When do you need a Database?",answer:"As soon as your project has too much data to be kept in spreadsheets, you may want to set up a database. A database differs from a collection of simple data files because it has a structure implemented in its design. \nA clever database design helps you shrink the hardware storage required to keep data. It also secures quick access to the data, making database queries run fast. These two factors are important if you want to get started with analytics or an application that uses a database."},{question:"Why do you need Database services?",answer:"Database management requires advanced IT knowledge, especially if your business has already overgrown the startup phase. There are a vast number of database technologies, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Databases take time to set up and maintain. Their downtimes cost money. \nTo reduce the business risks associated with database management, you need a reliable and skilled contractor on your side. If you have a running database already, you may need a consultant who can implement a better one or re-design your database to enhance its performance."},{question:"Which technologies should I take into account?",answer:"There are different types of databases. The traditional type is a relational database, in which tables have relationships expressed in keys. Non-relational databases have also emerged recently and keep gaining popularity. Finally, databases can be centralized or distributed.\nApart from this, to start with databases, you need to be familiar with different cloud computing providers, such as Amazon, Google, and Azure, since you will very almost certainly set up your database in one of them. \nFinally, there are numerous technologies for querying and managing databases, with SQL being the leading query language. v"},{question:"Which specialist does what in Database management?",answer:"Full-stack specialists are rare and may be a good solution only for small companies. Even middle-sized businesses usually need more than one specialist: one for each of the task domains in database management.\nFor instance, an architect will design a database or propose improvements to an existing one. A developer will implement it and perform regular maintenance. A database administrator will manage the database routinely, giving access to users and solving general issues."},{question:"How do I select the right Database specialist?",answer:"Database management is a skill set that adds new technologies rapidly. You should look to see whether a seller has experience with the most recent ones, since that would mean that he or she can build a fast and cost-saving database.\nSuch modern technologies may include virtualization, encryption, query optimization, and backup and recovery methods.\nFinally, SQL knowledge remains a must for every database specialist."}]},452:{metadata:{meta_title:"Data Processing Services Online | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Data Processing Services.

The last kind of information has to do with media and encompasses blog content, news articles, and social media.\nYou may notice that most data involved in data processing are publicly available on the internet or through open databases."},{question:"Which Data Processing technologies are the most popular?",answer:"Data collection can be manual and automated. Automated methods use programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Javascript, R, and others. The same languages can be utilized for data cleaning, formatting, and modeling. Alternatively, there are multiple tools that can be used for data processing, ranging from Excel sheets for beginners to more advanced tools such as MATLAB.\nIn most cases, you will need solid storage for your data: good options include those from the AWS family or based on Apache technology. Final results are usually delivered as a spreadsheet in Excel, OpenOffice, or Google."},{question:"What kind of expertise should you look for?",answer:"Sellers may work with different technologies. Tool-agnostic expertise can be divided into groups depending on your goal or project stage. \nAt the beginning of a project, you need expertise in data extraction, ETL (eject-transform-load), and formatting. SQL and NoSQL languages and API integration are useful here. For the next step, your seller needs to be familiar with data validation and normalization. The final stage may require some clustering and classification techniques. \nDepending on the tool, a data processing specialist may use formulas, macros, or functions at any of these stages."}]},453:{metadata:{meta_title:"Data Analytics Services Online | Fiverr",meta_description:"Affordable Data Analytics Services.

With spreadsheet-based tools, such as Excel and Google Sheets, you can perform a few basic transformations. For more radical transformations, a data analyst needs R or Python and, consequently, one of the applications working with these languages, such as R Studio or Jupyter Notebook.
